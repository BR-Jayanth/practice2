    <h1>HTML doctype</h1>
    <p>
        
In HTML, the DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) serves two crucial purposes:

<br>1. Informs the browser about the HTML version:

<br>The DOCTYPE tells the browser which version of HTML the document is <br>written in. This helps the browser interpret the code correctly and <br>render the page according to the specific version's rules.

<br>2. Enables standards mode:

<br>By specifying the HTML version, the DOCTYPE activates "standards <br>mode" in the browser. This mode ensures that the browser renders the <br>page according to the official HTML and CSS specifications, leading <br>to more predictable and consistent behavior across different browsers.
