   <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1> 
   <P>
    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It is used to define the structure and content of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML is a relatively simple language that can be learned by anyone with a basic understanding of computers.</P>
    <h3>Here are some of the basic building blocks of HTML:</h3>
    <p>Tags: Tags are the basic building blocks of HTML. They are used to mark up the content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and have a name and an optional set of attributes. For example, the following tag marks up a heading:</p>
   <!--
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
   -->
    <p>
        Elements: An element is a combination of a tag and its content. The content of an element is the text or other elements that are enclosed within the tag. For example, the following element is a heading that contains the text "This is a heading":
    </p>
    <!--
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    -->
    <p>
        Attributes: Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element. Attributes are specified within the tag's opening angle bracket and consist of a name and a value. For example, the following tag marks up an image with the source attribute set to "image.jpg":
    </p>
    <!--
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
    -->
    <!--

        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
